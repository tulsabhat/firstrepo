        text: `Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>

Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>

And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever be back.<br><br>

I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.`

With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>
You may trod me in the very dirt<br>
But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br><br>

Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
Pumping in my living room.<br><br>

Just like moons and like suns,<br>
With the certainty of tides,<br>
Just like hopes springing high,<br>
Still I'll rise.<br><br>

Did you want to see me broken?<br>
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br>
Weakened by my soulful cries?<br><br>

Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>
Don't you take it awful hard<br>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>
Diggin' in my own backyard.<br><br>

You may shoot me with your words,<br>
You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>
But still, like air, I'll rise.`

Every morning a new arrival.<br><br>

A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
some momentary awareness comes<br>
as an unexpected visitor.<br><br>

Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,<br>
who violently sweep your house<br>
empty of its furniture,<br>
still, treat each guest honorably.<br>
He may be clearing you out<br>
for some new delight.<br><br>

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br>
meet them at the door laughing,<br>
and invite them in.<br><br>

Be grateful for whoever comes,<br>
because each has been sent<br>
as a guide from beyond.`

I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size<br>
But when I start to tell them,<br>
They think I'm telling lies.<br><br>

I say,<br>
It's in the reach of my arms,<br>
The span of my hips,<br>
The stride of my step,<br>
The curl of my lips.<br>
I'm a woman<br>
Phenomenally.<br>
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.<br><br>

I walk into a room<br>
Just as cool as you please,<br>
And to a man,<br>
The fellows stand or<br>
Fall down on their knees.<br>
Then they swarm around me,<br>
A hive of honey bees.<br><br>

I say,<br>
It's the fire in my eyes,<br>
And the flash of my teeth,<br>
The swing in my waist,<br>
And the joy in my feet.<br>
I'm a woman<br>
Phenomenally.<br>
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.`

That perches in the soul -<br>
And sings the tune without the words -<br>
And never stops - at all -<br><br>

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
And sore must be the storm -<br>
That could abash the little Bird<br>
That kept so many warm -<br><br>

I've heard it in the chillest land -<br>
And on the strangest Sea -<br>
Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
It asked a crumb - of me.`

When the evening is spread out against the sky<br>
Like a patient etherized upon a table;<br>
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,<br>
The muttering retreats<br>
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels<br>
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:<br>
Streets that follow like a tedious argument<br>
Of insidious intent<br>
To lead you to an overwhelming question...<br>
Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"<br>
Let us go and make our visit.<br><br>

In the room the women come and go<br>
Talking of Michelangelo.<br><br>

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br>
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,<br>
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,<br>
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,<br>
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,<br>
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,<br>
And seeing that it was a soft October night,<br>
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.`
